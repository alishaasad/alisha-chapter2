CHAPTER 2: THE HAUNTED HOUSE

1. The old house on the duck (noun) was rumored to be haunted, but no one had ever dared to go on top of (preposition) it.

2. Alex and his friends decided to explore it on a pumpkin (noun). “We’ll be fine,” he said, although he was starting to feel voluptuous (adjective).

3. They snuck around to the back of the house, hoping to find a machete (noun). The air was poufy (adjective) around the house.

4. “I don’t like this,” Sarah laughed (verb). "What if there really is a chicken (noun) inside?"

5. Suddenly, the door pranced (verb) open by itself. It was the cutest (adjective) thing any of them had ever seen.

6. "I think we should sleep (verb)," Alex whispered, but Sarah yanked (verb) his arm, yanking (verb) him forward. "No, we need to find out what’s inside!"
